## Basics
These programs are basics - the kind of programs you'd expect to do while following a basic programming tutorial from scratch.

### hello
A basic Hello World program, which outputs the string "Hello, world!" to the console, and then exits.

### FizzBuzz
A program which outputs numbers from 1 to 100 when executed, but replaces each multiple of 3 with "Fizz", multiple of 5 with "Buzz", and multiples of 15 with "FizzBuzz".
