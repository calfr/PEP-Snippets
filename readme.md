## PEP Snippets

During Year 2 at my University, we're taught a module called Practical Experiences in Programming; where we learn C++ and Scala using fundamentals learned previously while using Java. I thought it may be helpful for my own learning to make various small programs which complete various tasks based on what I learn within the module, and wanted to share them here on my GitHub.

### Structure
At the top level, there will be a folder for C++ and a folder for Scala. Within each of these will be some rough categories:

- Basics contains basic snippets like the typical hello world,fizzbuzz and other similar applications.
- *Other categories will be introduced as relevant!*

### A note to future students
**None of the contents of this repository is intended to give you any answers to any coursework, and no assessed work has been, or will be, added to this repository.** Feel free to use the snippets here to help develop your understanding of the language - learning from experiences of others is great! However, when it comes to work for submission, you'll only truely learn through experience - just copying things of the internet won't be very helpful in the long run, especially when it comes to programming interviews and roles where you'd be expected to know how to do basic things on your own. Copying from this repository directly would also constitute plagarism; which every institution under the sun has rules against, and doing so can result in you being expelled - and I wouldn't want that :(

### Running programs
#### C++
You'll need a C++ compiler to compile these programs. I used g++ while developing this, and these instructions will assume you are too - if you're using Windows or other compilers, your mileage may vary.

Most programs within this repository will be self contained within a single file, which can be compiled easily using the command `g++ -o program <filename>`.

Later on, programs may become more complicated at which point makefiles may be present. If a makefile is present, instead run `make` within the directory of the complicated program to compile it.

#### Scala
*Instructions coming soon.*
